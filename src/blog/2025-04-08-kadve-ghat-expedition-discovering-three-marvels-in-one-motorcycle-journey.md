A Spontaneous Discovery of Hidden Wonders

Sometimes the most rewarding journeys are those that reveal unexpected treasures. As an avid fort enthusiast who had trekked to both Torna and Rajgad forts numerous times, I never imagined I could capture both these magnificent structures in a single frame, alongside the elusive Gunjavne Dam that I had only glimpsed from Torna's heights. Our recent motorcycle expedition to Kadve Ghat delivered precisely this trifecta of spectacular views, turning a simple breakfast ride into a journey of discovery.

## The Riders and Our Machines

Our small convoy assembled at Chandni Chowk at 6:00 AM—just ten minutes behind schedule but still early enough to beat the punishing summer heat. Four riders and one pillion made up our group, with a diverse collection of motorcycles:

* Two Triumph Scrambler 400X
* One Kawasaki Ninja
* One Triumph Speed 400 (carrying the pillion passenger, one rider's better half)

This blend of adventure-focused and sport-oriented machines proved perfect for the varied terrain we would encounter, from smooth highways to winding ghat roads.

## Plotting the Course: From City to Mountains

After quick fuel stops at Shell petrol pumps in Varje and Sinhagad Road, we charted a course that would take us through some of the most scenic landscapes near Pune. Our route unfolded as follows:

1. Chandni Chowk → NH4 → Sinhagad Road
2. Sinhagad Road → Khadakwasla Dam
3. Khadakwasla Dam → Donje Phata → Panshet Dam
4. Just before Panshet Dam, left turn onto Velhe-Panshet Road toward Kuran Khurd village
5. Kuran Khurd → left side of Panshet dam (offering views of the dam wall and release gates, now dry due to summer)
6. Straight ahead → right turn to Shikroli village
7. Village road → ascending Kadve Khind (Kadve Ghat)

The road conditions varied dramatically along this route. The stretch until Panshet Dam offered excellent tarmac perfect for motorcycle enthusiasts, with twisty sections that invited leaning into curves while maintaining vigilance for village dogs that occasionally dart across the road. After the Kuran Khurd turn, we encountered rougher tarmac that continued through the ghat section—challenging but manageable with careful riding.

## The Revelation: Three Wonders from One Viewpoint

Upon reaching the Kadve Ghat viewpoint, I was genuinely surprised to discover that this single location offered clear views of both Torna and Rajgad forts, along with Gunjavne Dam nestled between the hills. Having trekked both forts multiple times, seeing them together from this perspective provided a new appreciation for the Sahyadri mountain range's majestic topography.

We spent about 20 minutes at this vantage point, capturing photographs and soaking in the panorama. I attempted to climb a nearby hill for an even better 360-degree view, but the soil proved too unstable for safe exploration. We also investigated what appeared to be a basic soil road extending beyond our viewpoint, but after discovering it descended steeply after a few hundred meters, we decided to return to the main ghat road after taking a few more photographs.

## Change of Plans: The Gunjavne Dam Detour

My initial plan had been to return via the same route to Panshet, then continue to Varasgaon Dam, through the villages of Chikhli and Davaje to Mutha Village, and finally take the Temghar-Lavasa road that would lead home from another direction. However, when someone suggested visiting Gunjavne Dam directly, my eyes lit up with excitement.

Gunjavne Dam had always been visible from Torna Fort during my treks, and each time I had promised myself I would visit it after descending, yet never managed to do so. This unexpected opportunity was too good to pass up, and I enthusiastically agreed to the detour.

The dam offered spectacular photo opportunities, with Torna Fort particularly clear against the sky due to the exceptional weather conditions. Our group took full advantage, capturing numerous shots of the scenery, our motorcycles, and ourselves against this picturesque backdrop.

## The Return Journey: Misal and Highways

After thoroughly enjoying the dam visit, we headed toward the main road via Velha, though we didn't actually enter the town itself. Our route took us to RajToran Misal House, where I had enjoyed a meal about a year prior. The Velha road impressed us with its good condition, minimal traffic, and few village interruptions, allowing for some spirited riding as we made our way to breakfast.

At [RajToran](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HGJkgpNhJMdmXC3V8), all five of us indulged in misal and tea, with the entire bill coming to a remarkably reasonable Rs. 500. The misal was flavorful and satisfying, and the tea provided a perfect complement as we shared photographs and stories from the morning's adventure.

With breakfast complete, we began our journey home, reaching Nasrapur in just two minutes and then joining NH4. The highway allowed us to maintain speeds of 100-120 km/h, bringing us home in a brisk 40-45 minutes. By 10:30 AM, we had completed our 110 km breakfast trip, having experienced new vistas, shared riding experiences, and discovered places some of us had long wanted to visit.

## Practical Considerations for Fellow Riders

For those inspired to undertake a similar journey, a few important considerations should be kept in mind:

### Weather and Timing

We completed this ride during summer, starting early to avoid the worst of the heat. By reaching home at 10:30 AM, we managed to experience only acceptable levels of warmth during the latter part of our return. Visibility was excellent, allowing for clear views of distant landmarks.

### Rider Experience Level

Given the ghat conditions and potential for landslides (warning signs are posted throughout the area), I strongly recommend this route only for experienced riders. Novices, especially those traveling alone, should avoid this route due to its technical challenges. Group riding is strongly advised for safety.

### Connectivity and Isolation

Perhaps most importantly, there is no network connectivity between Panshet and Gunjavne Dam, and human presence in the area is minimal. While there are scattered farmhouses, the region is largely isolated. This makes group riding essential for safety, as assistance would be difficult to obtain in case of emergency.

## Conclusion: Short Distance, Long on Experience

This 110 km breakfast ride packed an impressive amount of discovery and enjoyment into a morning. Beyond the spectacular views and riding enjoyment, the journey offered valuable opportunities to meet new people, share experiences, and visit locations I had previously only seen from afar.

For motorcycle enthusiasts based in Pune, the Kadve Ghat route offers a perfect short expedition that delivers remarkable scenery, technical riding challenges, and a genuine sense of exploration—all before lunchtime. While demanding respect and experience from riders, it rewards them with vistas that combine historical magnificence with natural beauty in a single, sweeping panorama.

As I reflect on the journey, I'm reminded that sometimes the most significant discoveries lie just a short ride away, waiting to be revealed when approached from a different perspective.
