Raigad Fort has long held a special place in my heart. Memories of visiting during monsoon season as a child with my parents, riding the ropeway to the summit, and exploring the historic fortress have stayed with me over the years. This majestic fort, which served as the capital of the Maratha Empire from 1674, is filled with the echoes of history and the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's remarkable fortification engineering.

## Planning a Spontaneous Solo Ride

I decided to embark on a solo motorcycle journey to Raigad, planning a quick visit with a return home the same day. The round trip would cover approximately 280km from my home. Though the day promised to be hot, my enthusiasm wasn't dampened. I set out at noon, hoping to reach the fort by mid-afternoon.

## The Outbound Journey: Navigating the Heat

My route took me through the scenic Tamhini Ghat and onward via Nizampur. Road conditions were generally good, though the temperature was challenging. At several points along the journey, I was met with blasts of hot air that reminded me of the summer's intensity.

Past Nizampur, I encountered an unexpected hazard—portions of the road where the tar had melted under the extreme heat, creating slippery conditions. This prompted me to reduce my speed and proceed with caution. It's a useful reminder that even on seemingly perfect roads, weather conditions can create unexpected challenges for riders.

## A Brief Respite: Lunch Break

Around 1 PM, I stopped at Quite Bite restaurant for lunch. The mushroom curry and rice were delicious, if a bit expensive. The meal offered a welcome break from the road and the heat. I supplemented my meal with refreshing lemon juice and sugarcane juice, perfect remedies for the scorching day.

During my break, I took the opportunity to observe a few ropeway rides and chat with locals about the fort's operating hours. This proved to be valuable information: the ropeway closes after June 6th for approximately two months due to heavy rainfall, and the trekking route becomes inaccessible during monsoon due to landslides. The ropeway operates from 8 AM to 5 PM, though they stop sending people up at 5 PM and only bring visitors down until everyone has descended. The fort gates close by 6 PM, with similar timing for the trekking route.

## Reaching Raigad: A Distant Glimpse

Upon reaching the area, I could see the magnificent fort standing proudly atop the hill. My original plan hadn't included climbing the fort or using the ropeway—I had simply wanted to view it from a distance. However, after arriving, I found myself wishing I could ascend to explore its historic grounds. Unfortunately, I had arrived too late in the day and was traveling alone, making it impractical. I made a mental note to start earlier on my next visit to allow time for the ropeway journey and proper exploration of the fort.

## Exploring Pachad Fort: The Residence of Jijamata

Not wanting to waste the journey, I stopped at Pachad village to visit Pachad Kot (Pachad Fort), where Jijamata, the mother of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, had resided. This expansive property, still in reasonable condition, offered a different but equally significant historical perspective. I spent about 15 minutes exploring the fortifications.

Local tradition holds that Jijamata would come outside the Pachad Fort at sunrise and sunset. Interestingly, from the "Takmat Tok" point of Raigad Fort, one can see Pachad Kot at the base of the hill. It's said that Shivaji Maharaj would perform "Mujara" (show respect) to his mother from this vantage point—a touching historical detail that connects these two significant sites.

## Choosing an Alternate Return Route

Due to the slippery road conditions encountered earlier, I decided to take a different route for my return journey. From Pachad, I rode to Mahad, a journey of about 40 minutes. Though dusty and under construction, the road was navigable.

From Mahad, I joined the Mumbai-Goa highway until reaching Mangaon, where I took the Tamhini route. This segment followed the Mangaon-Nizampur-Tasgaon (Bhagad MIDC) route to Tamhini, with generally good road conditions. I made a brief stop for water before continuing.

## The Crown Jewel: Tamhini Ghat

Tamhini Ghat was, as always, the highlight of my ride. Currently in prime condition with smooth, pothole-free roads, this ghat section is a motorcyclist's dream. Having traversed this route many times before, I've developed a fondness for discovering its hidden gems.

This particular journey revealed a new treasure—a 50-meter offroad route after climbing the ghat, which offered the perfect vantage point for sunset viewing. I stopped here for half an hour, sitting in peaceful contemplation as the sun descended behind the mountains, painting the sky in vivid hues. These spontaneous discoveries are what make motorcycle journeys so rewarding.

After witnessing the magnificent sunset, I stopped at Hotel Dighe Darbar for a refreshing cup of tea before embarking on the final hour-long ride home.

## Reflections on the Journey

Despite covering 280 kilometers in a single day, I returned home feeling energized rather than exhausted. The combination of historical exploration, scenic beauty, and the pure joy of riding created a fulfilling experience. Though I didn't get to climb Raigad Fort this time, the journey itself—with its unexpected detours and discoveries—proved worthwhile.

## Planning Your Visit to Raigad Fort

If you're inspired to visit Raigad Fort, here are some practical tips based on my experience:

* **Best time to visit**: October to February offers pleasant weather. Avoid monsoon season (June-September) when many facilities close.
* **Ropeway information**: Operating hours are 8 AM to 5 PM. The last ascent is at 5 PM, with only descents permitted afterward. The ropeway closes for approximately two months after June 6th due to monsoon rains.
* **Trekking alternative**: A trekking route to the fort is available during dry seasons but closed during monsoon due to landslide risks.
* **Road conditions**: Routes through Tamhini Ghat offer excellent riding experiences, though summer heat can affect road conditions in some areas.
* **Time required**: Allow at least 4-5 hours at the fort if you plan to explore it thoroughly. Starting your journey early in the morning is advisable.
* **Historical significance**: As the capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maratha Empire from 1674, Raigad Fort holds immense historical importance in Maharashtra's heritage.

This solo motorcycle journey reminded me that sometimes the most fulfilling adventures are those undertaken spontaneously, with an open mind to discover whatever the road presents. While I may not have climbed Raigad Fort this time, the journey has only strengthened my resolve to return—next time, earlier in the day, ready to ascend to the historic heights of the Maratha Empire's capital.

Until then, the memories of winding roads, historical discoveries, and that perfect sunset in Tamhini Ghat will sustain my wanderlust.
