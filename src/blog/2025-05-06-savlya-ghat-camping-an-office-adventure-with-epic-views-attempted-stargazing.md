Sometimes, a fleeting moment plants a seed for a future adventure. Back in [November 2024, on the way during an office trip, a couple of friends and I spent about an hour at Savlya Ghat](https://travellingtrails.in/savlya-ghat-hidden-paradise-in-sahyadri-with-breathtaking-valley-views/). The view was simply breathtaking – a true hidden gem nestled in the Sahyadri mountains. I left wishing I could return, a thought that lingered until an opportunity arose.

A few colleagues were keen on a small trek and camping trip, somewhere peaceful. Suddenly, Savlya Ghat clicked back into my mind. It felt perfect – relatively isolated, offering potential for incredible stargazing, especially during the clear skies often seen in April and May. The idea quickly gained traction: an overnight stay in tents, complete with dinner under the stars (or so we hoped!). With our office generously sponsoring the trip, we finalized the dates – April 25th and 26th. My second, much-awaited visit to this spot was finally happening, this time with a fantastic group.

### Assembling the Crew & Hitting the Road

Our rendezvous point was near Chandni Chowk in Pune. Sixteen enthusiastic colleagues, a vibrant mix spanning ages 24 to 55 – from fresh joiners to seasoned veterans whose experience outweighed some of our years on earth – gathered with four cars. There's a unique dynamic to office trips; unlike college friends where familiarity is deep-rooted, these excursions offer a chance to bridge the professional gap, understand colleagues on a personal level, and strengthen bonds. This trip felt like an exciting experiment in team building, wrapped in the thrill of adventure.

We set off around 3:30 PM, heading towards Tamhini Ghat. The traffic was manageable, and within an hour, we neared Nivhe Village. A quick regroup and tea break at [Hotel Jai Malhar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oZynwMxr6n4HAgKX8), just before the turn-off from the main Tamhini road, revitalized us for the final leg to our base. By 5:30 PM, we reached [Paratewadi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RqkbG3XJix6ianJN6) and parked near our starting point, the Devkund View Hotel & Home Stay. After a quick freshen-up, we wasted no time starting the trek towards the Savlya Ghat viewpoint. Our immediate goal: reach the spot before sunset to familiarize ourselves with the surroundings and soak in the initial views.

### The Uphill Battle (Literally!)

The trek itself is generally considered beginner-friendly, usually taking about 40 minutes. However, our journey clocked in closer to 90 minutes. Why the delay? Supplies. We were hauling three massive 18-litre water cans – a decision that prompted much laughter later – along with snacks, five tents, our personal backpacks, torches, a hefty solar-powered light for backup, Odomos to fend off mosquitoes, and a necessary medical kit. Descending one hill and ascending another, laden with gear, tested our endurance but fueled our anticipation.

### An Amphitheater of Valleys

Reaching the [viewpoint](https://maps.app.goo.gl/556Fx5AWFFwb4ofMA) just as the light began to fade was worth every drop of sweat. Savlya Ghat isn't a vast plateau; it's a relatively small rock outcrop, protruding boldly from the hillside, yet easily capable of accommodating around 50 people. It commands a truly spectacular position, acting as a natural balcony overlooking an amphitheater of three valleys.

The panoramic vista is stunning: the shimmering backwaters of the Bhira Dam stretch out below, while in the distance (especially visible at night), the lights of an MIDC area and surrounding villages twinkle. We could trace the locations of Kondhera Falls and Ring Waterfall, spot the Devkund waterfall trail and the fall itself, and identify the paths leading into Plus Valley and Kundalika Valley. To the right stood the imposing Jambhya Dongar, while a unique mushroom-shaped hill captured attention on the left. Even in the dry summer heat, the surrounding valleys retained a surprising density of forest cover.

### Racing the Dark & Setting Up Camp

With daylight dwindling fast, we sprang into action. The mission: get all five tents pitched before complete darkness enveloped us. Sixteen pairs of hands made light work of it, and soon our temporary shelters stood tall against the fading skyline. Exhausted from the trek and the setup, we took a well-deserved break. Sipping on Glucon D, we rested, catching our breath and sharing initial impressions – the trek, the views, the slightly questionable decision to carry *that* much water, and the first-time tent-building experiences (another source of great amusement).

As dusk deepened, the conversations flowed, punctuated by laughter and the crunching of Lehsuni Shev. We spread out mats, eagerly awaiting dinner, which was being delivered to our remote location by the team from Devkund View Hotel. Surprisingly, despite the isolation, we had a solid 5G connection! Around 8 PM, two distinct headlamp beams bobbed towards us through the darkness – our dinner had arrived. By 8:30 PM, we were tucking into a delicious spread: flavourful chicken gravy and masala, chapatis, rice and jowar bhakris, and steamed rice. The vegetarian thali offered two hearty vegetable dishes alongside the staples. It was a fantastic meal, fueling more conversation and camaraderie under the vast night sky.

### Chasing Stars, Capturing Light

Post-dinner, my focus shifted to the night sky. I set up my tripod, hoping to capture the celestial canvas. My initial dream of pitch-dark conditions perfect for viewing the Milky Way core wasn't quite realized. Hazy conditions and intermittent clouds played hide-and-seek with the stars all night. Furthermore, while not overwhelming, light pollution from the distant MIDC did subtly impact naked-eye visibility.

However, modern phone camera sensors work wonders. I managed to capture impressively dense star fields and detailed shots of the hill skylines against the night. A few colleagues and I decided to forgo sleep entirely, determined to witness the Milky Way, constantly battling the interfering clouds. We clicked numerous photos and videos, documenting our nocturnal vigil.

Around 4 AM, our persistence paid off. The clouds parted slightly, revealing a tantalizingly thin, hazy layer of the Milky Way. I quickly captured a few shots that, despite the challenging conditions, turned out mind-blowing. Still, the photographer's lament remained – I wished I could have seen more of that galactic grandeur with my own eyes, rather than solely through the lens.

Earlier in the night, just before the sky briefly cleared, a distinct rumbling sound echoed from the direction of Plus Valley. We couldn't see anything in the dark, but the unmistakable noise of a small landslide was enough to startle us and wake a few sleeping colleagues. The excitement didn't end there. The six or seven of us still awake decided a pre-dawn snack was in order. We gathered some firewood, cooked Maggi, and enjoyed the simple pleasure of hot noodles in the cool night air, though most of our campmates slept soundly through our culinary adventure. The weather remained relatively mild until about 5 AM, when a noticeable predawn chill set in, lasting until sunrise.

### Dawn, Descent, and Disappointment

As the first hints of light painted the eastern sky around 5:30 AM, the rest of the camp began to stir. The summer sunrise arrived quickly. It was time to dismantle our temporary home. We efficiently packed the tents, gathered our belongings, and meticulously collected every bit of trash into a designated bag. After some obligatory group photos against the magnificent backdrop, we began our return trek in stages. I lingered with the last group of five or six, maximizing photo opportunities on the way down.

By 8:30 AM, we were back at the parking area in Paratewadi, ready for the drive home. We stopped en route for breakfast at [Hotel Sharda Pure Veg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7biVLvtNrJsJTGYq8), but unfortunately, the experience wasn't great – both food quality and service left something to be desired, and it's not a place I'd readily recommend. Thankfully, the drive back to the office near Chandni Chowk was smooth, with minimal traffic, taking just about an hour.

### Reflections on a Rewarding Escape

The trip was undeniably exhausting, but the beauty of the night out, the camaraderie, and the sheer magnificence of Savlya Ghat made it incredibly rewarding. We shared good food, strengthened team bonds, captured countless photos, and created lasting memories.

Would I recommend Savlya Ghat? Absolutely, for the views. It’s a fantastic spot for a day trip or a simple overnight camp to soak in the scenery. Visit anytime outside the two heaviest monsoon months. However, if your primary goal is serious stargazing, be aware of the limitations: the altitude isn't exceptionally high, light pollution from the MIDC is a factor, and the local weather patterns, especially cloud cover, can be unpredictable.

But even with the stargazing challenges, the view from that rocky outcrop? It truly captures your heart.
