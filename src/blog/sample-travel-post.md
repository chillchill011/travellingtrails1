## Discovering Hidden Beaches in Bali

Bali is known for its popular beaches like Kuta and Seminyak, but the island also hides many secluded beaches that offer tranquility and natural beauty away from the crowds.

### Nyang Nyang Beach

Located in the Uluwatu area, Nyang Nyang Beach requires a short hike down a cliff, which keeps most tourists away. The reward is a long stretch of white sand, crystal clear water, and very few people.

### Green Bowl Beach

This small beach in the Ungasan area gets its name from the green algae-covered rocks that appear at low tide. The beach is accessed via a steep staircase with hundreds of steps, but the secluded cove and natural beauty are worth the effort.

### Gunung Payung Beach

Hidden behind the Gunung Payung temple, this beach requires a challenging descent down hundreds of steps carved into the cliff. The pristine waters and magnificent cliff views make it a perfect spot for those seeking solitude.

## Best Time to Visit

The best time to explore these hidden beaches is during the dry season from April to October. The water is clearer for snorkeling, and the hiking paths to reach these secluded spots are less slippery.

## Getting Around

Renting a scooter is the best way to access these hidden beaches. Most require some hiking, so wear comfortable shoes and bring plenty of water.

Remember to respect these pristine environments by taking all your trash with you when you leave.
