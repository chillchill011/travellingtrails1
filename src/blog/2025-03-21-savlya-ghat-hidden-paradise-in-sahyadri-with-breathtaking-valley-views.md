There are journeys where the destination surpasses the ride, and my recent adventure to Savlya Ghat was precisely that kind of experience. While I typically find more joy in the journey than the destination, this hidden gem in Maharashtra's Sahyadri range captivated my heart in unexpected ways.

## An Impromptu Adventure

It began as a spontaneous morning ride on November 16th, 2024. Before our scheduled office trip to Jalbaug Resort, two friends and I decided to squeeze in a quick motorcycle adventure. Our small convoy consisted of three bikes—my Triumph, a Royal Enfield Scram 411, and a Yamaha R15 V3. Little did I know that this impromptu excursion would lead to one of the most memorable views I've experienced in the Western Ghats.

## The Journey to Paratewadi

Our route took us through the renowned Tamhini Ghat, which was in pristine condition. The smooth, winding roads made for a delightful ride through the misty morning air. Around halfway through the ghat, we took a diversion toward Ambey Valley/Lonavla—the same route that leads to Andarban Trek Point.

After a brief ride along this diversion, we turned left and continued for about two minutes before another right turn appeared. This final turn led us to our initial destination: the small village of Paratewadi, which serves as the parking and access point for Savlya Ghat.

The approach to Paratewadi had an air of exclusivity about it. We rode past fencing belonging to what appeared to be an ashram, with ongoing construction visible though no workers were present during our visit. The narrow road eventually opened to a small clearing where we parked our motorcycles.

## Beginning the Descent

At the parking area, the owner collected Rs. 50 per motorcycle—a reasonable fee considering the location. One of my friends, an office colleague who had visited before, could barely contain his excitement. "You have to see this view," he insisted, practically pulling me toward the trail. I was completely unaware of what lay ahead or how far we would need to trek.

The descent into the valley took approximately 20 minutes. Though the path wasn't marked with official signage, previous visitors had tied colorful ribbons on tree trunks, creating a makeshift but effective trail marker system. The route involved a series of descents and small ascents before the final descent to reach the plateau of Savlya Ghat.

## The Revelation: Panoramic Bliss

Nothing could have prepared me for what awaited us. As we emerged onto the plateau, a panoramic vista unfolded before my eyes—an expansive view that seemed to encompass the entirety of this section of the Sahyadri range.

The plateau itself was surprisingly spacious, easily able to accommodate a hundred people, though we had it almost entirely to ourselves. Positioned in the middle of two valleys, it offered a 360-degree viewpoint that was nothing short of spectacular.

From this vantage point, we could clearly see numerous landmarks: Andarban Trek Point, Devkund Waterfall Trek, Plus Valley Waterfall, and the sprawling Kundalika Valley with Jambhlya Dongar rising in the distance. The backwaters of Bhira Dam glinted in the sunlight, while the Kundalika River snaked its way through the landscape below.

## A Moment of Tranquility

We settled on the plateau, finding comfortable spots to sit and absorb the tranquility. Despite visiting after the monsoon season had passed, waterfalls still cascaded down distant cliffs, their sounds carrying across the valley in the calm air.

For half an hour, we sat in near silence, taking in the breathtaking scenery. The lush greenery, numerous water bodies, faint trails cutting across hillsides, small huts dotting the landscape, and the distinctive mushroom-shaped hills against the backdrop of Sahyadri's vertical cliff faces created a tableau of natural beauty that felt almost surreal.

I found myself imagining how this same view would transform during different seasons: the vibrant intensity of full monsoon with waterfalls at their mightiest, or clear winter nights perfect for stargazing far from city lights. In those moments of reflection, I knew I would be returning here again.

## The Return Journey

After our peaceful interlude, we began the ascent back to the parking area. The uphill trek was more challenging than the descent, taking between 30-40 minutes of steady climbing. Being experienced trekkers, we managed it without much difficulty, but the importance of proper footwear became apparent on the steeper sections where steps had been carved into the stone.

Small natural ponds dotted the route, containing collected rainwater. While these make for pretty sights, I would advise against drinking from them without proper filtration.

## Practical Considerations for Fellow Travelers

For those inspired to visit Savlya Ghat, here are some practical tips based on our experience:

1. **Accessibility**: The trek requires moderate fitness. While experienced trekkers could visit solo, I recommend groups of 3-4 people, especially for first-time visitors.
2. **Duration**: Allow approximately 20 minutes for the descent and 30-40 minutes for the ascent, plus whatever time you wish to spend at the plateau (at least 30 minutes is recommended to fully appreciate the views).
3. **Essentials**: Proper trekking shoes are mandatory. Carry sufficient water and some snacks. There are no facilities once you leave the parking area.
4. **Mobile Connectivity**: Network coverage is limited to non-existent in the valley. Inform someone about your plans before descending.
5. **Safety**: While not particularly dangerous, normal trekking precautions apply. You'll encounter few if any people once past the parking area.
6. **Best Time to Visit**: Post-monsoon offers lush greenery with safer conditions than during heavy rains, though the monsoon would provide the most dramatic waterfall views for those willing to navigate potentially slippery terrain.

## Final Reflections

As someone who typically finds more joy in the journey than the destination, Savlya Ghat was a surprising exception. This hidden plateau with its commanding views of the Sahyadri range provided exactly the kind of natural sanctuary that reminds us why we seek out these lesser-known spots.

The combination of a smooth motorcycle ride through Tamhini Ghat followed by a moderate trek leading to such a spectacular reward makes this journey particularly satisfying. Whether you're a photography enthusiast, nature lover, trekker, or motorcycle tourer looking to discover Maharashtra's hidden gems, Savlya Ghat deserves a place on your must-visit list.

As we rode back toward Jalbaug Resort to join our office colleagues, I carried with me not just photographs but a mental image of those valleys and cliffs that would stay with me far longer than the soreness in my legs. In the crowded landscape of Western Ghat destinations, Savlya Ghat stands out as a peaceful plateau of perfection, waiting to be discovered by those willing to make the descent.
