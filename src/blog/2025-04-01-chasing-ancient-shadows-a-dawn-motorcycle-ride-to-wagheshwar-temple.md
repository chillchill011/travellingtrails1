Unearthing History: The Call of the Submerged Temple

There's something undeniably alluring about visiting places that exist only temporarily—locations that nature reclaims for most of the year, revealing their secrets during brief windows of opportunity. The ancient Wagheshwar Temple near Pawana Dam is precisely such a treasure—a Chalukya-era monument that spends most of its life submerged beneath dam waters, visible only during the peak summer months when water levels recede.

When I learned that this historic temple was currently exposed due to falling water levels, I immediately reached out to two riding companions, proposing an early morning motorcycle adventure to witness this rarely-seen relic. The opportunity to combine a scenic dawn ride with historical exploration proved irresistible, and plans quickly fell into place for a 5:45 AM departure the following morning.

## The Dawn Departure: Three Bikes, One Destination

Our small convoy consisted of three distinct motorcycles: my Triumph Scrambler 400X, a Honda CB 350, and a Royal Enfield Scram 411—a fitting trio for an adventure that would include both highway riding and some unexpected off-road challenges.

![Three motorcycles - Triumph Scrambler 400X, Royal Enfield Scram 411, and Honda CB 350 - parked along bridge railing with scenic view of dam waters and Sahyadri mountains in the background](/assets/images/three-motorcycles-one-adventure-our-riding-companions-at-kadadhe-bridge.jpg "Three Motorcycles, One Adventure: Our Riding Companions at Kadadhe Bridge")

Setting out from Chandni Chowk while the city still slept, I met my first companion, and together we rode toward Chandkhed where our third friend awaited. Though it would have been quicker to meet elsewhere, we motorcycle enthusiasts rarely choose the shortest route when a more scenic alternative presents itself. The morning air carried a surprising coolness that belied the season, though we all knew the reprieve would be temporary as summer tightened its grip on the region.

## The Journey: Mountain Vistas and Winding Roads

After meeting our third rider in Chandkhed, we continued along roads that gradually deteriorated in condition. The segment until Kadadhe Bridge proved particularly challenging, requiring careful navigation around potholes and uneven surfaces. At the bridge, we paused for our first proper break, letting the landscape photographer in each of us emerge. Phones and cameras documented the serene morning light playing across the water while we stretched our legs.

One rider took the opportunity to fuel up at Kadadhe village's HP petrol pump—a wise precaution given the remote nature of our destination. From Pavana Nagar, we veered toward the left side of Pawana Dam, and it was here that the scenery transformed dramatically. Though not lush with greenery during summer, the panorama impressed with mountains in every direction.

The route revealed a series of quaint cafes, hotels, and campgrounds dotting the lakeside—evidence of the area's popularity as a weekend retreat from Pune's urban bustle. On our left, the distinctive triangular silhouette of Tikona Fort commanded attention, while the blue-hued outlines of Lohgad and Visapur Forts emerged on our right horizon. This triumvirate of historic fortifications framing the landscape created a powerful sense of traveling through time as much as space.

## The Navigation Challenge: Finding a Temple That Isn't There

What online maps won't tell you is that finding Wagheshwar Temple requires local knowledge and persistence. I had read reviews warning that the Google Maps location was misleading, but like many before us, we still initially fell victim to misdirection. We found ourselves tantalizingly close, able to see the temple in the distance across the dried lakebed, yet separated by terrain our motorcycles couldn't cross.

After encountering several other confused visitors similarly searching for access, we backtracked and began looking for the true entry point. The key landmark proved to be the newer Wagheshwar Temple and Jalsa Resort and Camping. From there, a right turn led to an unexpected challenge—a 500-600 meter stretch of off-road riding across the dried lakebed.

This impromptu off-road section featured thick, soft soil that tested our riding skills. The surface, while not hardpacked, was forgiving in its own way—when one of our companions lost control and fell, both rider and motorcycle emerged virtually unscathed thanks to the cushioning effect of the powdery earth. Despite the minor mishap, this unplanned off-road segment added an element of adventure that enhanced our journey's narrative.

## The Destination: Wagheshwar Temple Revealed

We finally reached the temple at 8:10 AM, and my first impression was one of modest surprise. The structure itself is smaller than I had imagined—certainly not the grand complex one might expect given its historical significance. Its surface, appearing white from a distance, revealed itself on closer inspection to be covered in bird droppings—an inevitable consequence of being the only elevated perch in a vast expanse of dried lakebed.

Despite its somewhat diminished state, the temple's setting compensated magnificently. Standing beside this ancient structure, we were treated to a 360-degree panorama that included Pawana Lake's remaining waters, Tikona Fort rising proudly to our right, and the distant blue silhouettes of Lohgad and Visapur Forts. The entire Sahyadri range encircled us, its reflection shimmering in the remaining water—a view that commanded silence and appreciation.

## Historical Reflections: The Temple's Story

As we explored the temple more closely, the ravages of time and submersion became evident. Most original carvings and artwork have been lost to centuries of weathering and decades of annual flooding since the dam's construction. The stones now bear a coat of coral-like deposits, testament to their underwater existence for much of the year.

One of our group, a civil engineer by profession, pointed out evidence of later reconstruction efforts. Many stones appeared to have been simply stacked, reinforced with steel rods to provide stability. The outer walls showed signs of having been filled with additional stones to maintain structural integrity. Nevertheless, the central portion of the temple with its pillared hall seemed to retain more original elements, though detailed carvings have largely eroded away.

Surrounding the main structure, we discovered scattered architectural elements—isolated stones with unidentifiable art, small satellite shrines, and a Tulsi Vrindavan (holy basil planter). Each fragment told of a once more extensive complex, now reduced to archaeological whispers by nature's relentless cycle.

This inevitable deterioration stirred a certain melancholy—here stood a testament to human creativity and devotion, gradually being reclaimed by the very environment it was built to venerate. Yet there was beauty in this cycle too, a reminder that even our most enduring creations eventually return to the landscapes from which they arose.

## The Return Journey: Different Routes, Shared Memories

After spending about 40 minutes at the temple and engaging in an impromptu stone-skimming contest to determine who would cover breakfast (I lost), we began the return journey as temperatures started climbing noticeably. Our hunger led us to Jalsa Resort and Camping for a simple but satisfying breakfast.

At Javan village, our paths diverged—our Chandkhed-based companion headed home while my remaining riding partner and I continued via Paud. This route offered superior road conditions and less traffic, winding through familiar Tamhini mountain landscapes. After passing through Paud, the final stretch back to Pune felt almost effortless despite growing heat, our minds still processing the morning's discoveries.

## Practical Tips for Fellow Temple Seekers

If you're inspired to undertake your own pilgrimage to the submerged temple, here are some practical recommendations based on our experience:

1. **Timing is everything**: Visit only during summer months (March to early June) when dam water levels are at their lowest. By monsoon season, the temple will be completely underwater again.
2. **Start early**: An early morning departure not only provides beautiful lighting for photography but also allows you to explore before the day's heat becomes oppressive.
3. **Navigation**: Don't rely solely on Google Maps. Look for the *new* Wagheshwar Temple and Jalsa Resort as your landmarks, then ask locally for the final approach.
4. **Off-road preparation**: Be prepared for the final 500-600 meters of off-road riding across soft, dried lakebed soil. This section can be challenging for motorcycles and virtually impossible for regular cars.
5. **Vehicle choice**: If possible, choose a motorcycle with some off-road capability. While any bike can make the journey, those with appropriate tires and ground clearance will have an easier time with the final approach.
6. **Provisions**: Carry water and snacks. While there are establishments like Jalsa Resort nearby, the immediate temple area has no facilities.
7. **Photography timing**: The morning light creates beautiful reflections on the remaining water. If photography is your priority, plan to be at the temple between 7:30-9:00 AM.
8. **Footwear**: Bring appropriate footwear for walking on the uneven, sometimes muddy lakebed surrounding the temple.

## Reflection: The Journey and the Destination

Would I visit Wagheshwar Temple again? While the temple itself, stripped of much of its original detail, might not warrant repeated visits, the journey there most certainly does. The combination of mountain vistas, fort silhouettes, and lake reflections creates a landscape that draws you back regardless of the destination's specific merits.

This experience reinforced what many motorcycle enthusiasts already know—sometimes the journey itself forms the most valuable part of our adventures. The shared experience of navigation challenges, the impromptu off-road section, and the camaraderie of early morning riding created memories more lasting than any single destination could provide.

For those who appreciate the confluence of natural beauty, history, and adventure, this hidden temple emerging from receding waters offers a unique opportunity to witness a place that exists in its accessible form for only a brief window each year. Like many of life's most meaningful experiences, its ephemeral nature only enhances its value.

When the monsoon rains return and Wagheshwar Temple slips back beneath the rising waters of Pawana Dam, it will carry with it the echoes of our visit—one brief moment in its centuries-long story of emergence and submergence, remembering and forgetting, that continues with each passing year.
