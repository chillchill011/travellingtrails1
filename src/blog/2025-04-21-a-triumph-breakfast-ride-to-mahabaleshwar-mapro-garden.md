The rumble of a Triumph engine is something special. Ever since getting my own bike, I'd heard about the Triumph Riders Pune (TRP) group. Joining them for a ride became a goal, a chance to connect with fellow enthusiasts and learn from more seasoned riders piloting the bigger machines – the 1200cc beasts, the versatile 900s, and the sporty 600s, alongside riders on the newer 400cc platform like mine.

These groups often have strict rules, which, while seeming tricky at first, are fundamentally about ensuring everyone's safety. Gearing up properly wasn't an overnight affair; I acquired my safety armour piece by piece over three to four months, building anticipation for that first ride. Finally, the day arrived – a breakfast ride planned for Mahabaleshwar's famous Mapro Garden, with a side trip to Lingmala Waterfall and plenty of photo opportunities pencilled in. The initial plan aimed for roughly 260+ km in about 6 hours, though fate, as it often does on rides, had other ideas.

### Joining the Thundering Herd

While the official start was the Triumph Showroom in Pashan, like a few others, I joined the ride at the second regrouping point – the Shell petrol pump at Varve, about 25km down the road. It's common practice for riders coming from different parts of the city.

Pulling in, I was greeted by the sight and sound of about a dozen Triumphs – a fantastic mix representing the brand's diversity. There were rugged Adventure bikes, cool Bobbers, sleek Racing models, comfortable Sports Tourers, and, of course, the nimble 400cc Scramblers and Speeds. It was a true Triumph clan, and the collective growl and rumble from those iconic double and triple-cylinder engines were exactly what I'd been waiting to experience.

### Highway Bliss and Ghat Thrills

We rolled out from the Shell pump just before 7 am, heading towards the hills. On the open highway, our performance bikes barely broke a sweat. We settled into a comfortable cruising speed of 80-100 kmph, the engines humming contentedly. The infamous twisties of Khambatki Ghat were a joy to navigate, each rider flowing through the curves.

About 50km later, near Surur, our smooth progress hit a snag – road work had closed our intended route. Adapting quickly, the lead riders decided to continue straight on the highway to the next viable turn near Joshi Vihir, connecting to the Wai-Wathar road. A right turn towards Wai put us onto a two-lane road. Despite being narrower, the tarmac was smooth and surprisingly empty, barring a short, manageable stretch of road work. Impressively, we maintained our highway pace even here – a testament to the road quality and the bikes' capabilities.

Another brief stop at an Indian Oil pump in Wai allowed some riders to top up their tanks. I felt a surge of excitement; the Mahabaleshwar ghat section was next, a road I'd last ridden a couple of months prior during the Solashi Windmill trip. Luck was on our side – traffic was minimal. We leaned into the hairpin bends, twisting the throttle through the curves, ascending quickly towards our breakfast destination.

### Mapro Garden: Sweet Scents and Unexpected Delays

We arrived at Mapro Garden around 8 am. The air was already filled with the sweet, signature aroma of strawberries, chocolates, jellies, and juices. This place is a perennial favourite, bustling with families, couples, and groups – a vibrant atmosphere. We were all eager for a hearty breakfast: pizzas, sandwiches, and the much-loved strawberry or mango cream creations.

After freshening up, we headed to order, only to encounter a bit of a setback. The place seemed strangely quiet for that hour, and the staff were busy cleaning the kitchen area. We were informed it would take nearly an hour before orders could be prepared. The wait stretched closer to 9:15 am before our food started arriving, resulting in almost a two-hour delay from our anticipated schedule. Despite being a frequent visitor (this marked my double-digit visit!), the delay was unexpected. While waiting, a few of us indulged in some shopping, picking up signature Mapro goodies.

### The Homeward Stretch: Racing the Sun

Given the significant delay at Mapro, the decision was made to skip the Lingmala Waterfall visit. The priority shifted to getting back home before the midday sun reached its peak intensity, especially knowing the pleasant coolness of Mahabaleshwar's altitude wouldn't last once we descended back to the highway plains during this unusually hot summer.

The ride down saw slightly more traffic until we reached the Joshi Vihir turn-off. From there, we retraced our path back towards the main highway. As we merged back onto the wider roads, goodbyes were exchanged, and throttles were opened. The cruising speed climbed to around 120 kmph as we aimed for home.

I might have pushed myself a bit too hard on that return leg. Focused on getting back, I skipped a water break, riding straight through. By the time I reached home around 12 pm, the effects were noticeable. Despite the wind blast, the heat had taken its toll, leaving me feeling tired and distinctly dehydrated.

Even so, the exhaustion couldn't completely erase the morning's experience. The thrill of riding with the TRP group, the symphony of engines, the scenic ghat roads, and yes, even the lingering sweet taste of Mapro strawberries, made it a memorable first ride with the clan. A reminder, perhaps, to always stay hydrated, but also a confirmation that the journey, even with its unexpected turns, is always worth it.
